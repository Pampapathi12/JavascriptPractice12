Sure! The line `return new Promise((resolve) => rl.question(query, resolve));` involves creating a new Promise and using the `readline` module to ask a question. Let's break it down step by step.

### Understanding Promises

A `Promise` is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It has three states:
- **Pending:** Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled:** The operation completed successfully.
- **Rejected:** The operation failed.

### The readline Module

The `readline` module provides an interface for reading data from a `Readable` stream (such as process.stdin) one line at a time.

### The `question` Method

The `question` method of the readline interface is used to prompt the user with a query and get the input. It takes two arguments:
1. **query:** The question or prompt string to display to the user.
2. **callback:** A function to handle the user's response.

### The Full Line Explanation

```javascript
return new Promise((resolve) => rl.question(query, resolve));
```

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Creating a Promise:**
   ```javascript
   return new Promise((resolve) => ...);
   ```
   - `new Promise` creates a new Promise object.
   - The constructor of the `Promise` takes a function (called the executor function) as an argument. This function has two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.

2. **Executor Function:**
   ```javascript
   (resolve) => rl.question(query, resolve)
   ```
   - The executor function here only uses the `resolve` parameter.
   - It is an arrow function that takes `resolve` as its parameter and calls `rl.question`.

3. **Calling `rl.question`:**
   ```javascript
   rl.question(query, resolve)
   ```
   - `rl.question` is called with two arguments: `query` and `resolve`.
   - `query` is the prompt string to display to the user.
   - `resolve` is the callback function to handle the user's response.
   
4. **Handling the Response:**
   - `rl.question` waits for the user to input a response.
   - When the user provides a response, `rl.question` calls the `resolve` function, passing the user's input as the argument.
   - This `resolve` function resolves the Promise with the user's input.

**In Summary:**

- `return new Promise((resolve) => rl.question(query, resolve));` creates and returns a new Promise.
- The executor function of the Promise calls `rl.question`.
- `rl.question` displays the prompt (`query`) to the user and waits for input.
- When the user provides input, `rl.question` calls the `resolve` function with the user's input.
- The Promise is resolved with the user's input, making it available for `await` or `.then` to handle the result.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how this line would be used in a larger context:

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

function askQuestion(query) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => rl.question(query, resolve));
}

async function main() {
  const answer = await askQuestion('What is your name? ');
  console.log(`Hello, ${answer}!`);
  rl.close();
}

main();
```

**Explanation of Example:**

1. **readline Interface:**
   - `readline.createInterface` creates an interface for reading input from `process.stdin` and writing output to `process.stdout`.

2. **askQuestion Function:**
   - `askQuestion` prompts the user with a question (`query`).
   - It returns a Promise that resolves with the user's input.

3. **main Function:**
   - `main` is an async function that uses `await` to pause execution until `askQuestion` resolves.
   - `await askQuestion('What is your name? ')` waits for the user's input and stores it in `answer`.
   - `console.log` prints a greeting using the user's input.
   - `rl.close` closes the readline interface.

By understanding this step-by-step breakdown, you can see how the Promise encapsulates the asynchronous behavior of `rl.question`, allowing it to be used seamlessly with `async` and `await`.
