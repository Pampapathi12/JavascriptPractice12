        I have prepared SKU-wise stock norms based on sale trends and weekly variations in demand for each SKU,
        factoring in lead times for material distribution across all depots based on key sales regions. Weekly
        sequencing was adjusted to meet/exceed stock norms per region’s sales drives. Production shortfall for the
        current week was discussed with the factory and scheduled into subsequent weeks, based on line availability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Started weekly calls with factory teams on Fridays/Saturdays to ensure alignment with the upcoming week’s plans.
        Priorities and urgencies were communicated to the factory to ensure adherence. I promptly reported any deviation
        from the plan for priority SKUs to identify the root cause (e.g., PM unavailability, breakdown, manpower
        shortages) and assess further timelines for production readiness.
    </li>
    <li>
        Shared daily/weekly production deficit reports with factory heads to highlight SKU-wise SW/HW production
        deficits and identify potential capacity increases to recover lost production. For example, due to a 200ml Pump
        shortage, I shared PC-wise requirements to run Baddi's six-head line in two shifts (currently single-shift) and
        diverted Twin head plans to other factories to boost daily output and meet BLITZ demand.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modified sequencing based on brand-wise mid-quarter and last 3-week estimates. Prepared quarter-end inventory
        norms for each SKU to ensure brand inventory limits are maintained. I shared SKU-wise reduction plans for
        WK12/WK13 across factories to manage quarter-end inventory based on current stock levels, expected sales, and
        quarter-end norms, without compromising on quarter-end sales targets.
    </li>
    <li>
        Communicated any expected increase/decrease in production plans with factories to align RM/PM planning
        accordingly. For example, for BIG Day, based on sales estimates, I shared required PM cover with individual
        factories for 675ml BOGO SKUs.
