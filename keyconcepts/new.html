    <li>As a planner, to ensure saleable stocks are maintained in the system, I have discussed the list of
        non-moving/slow-moving inventory for Giffy, MaxKleen, and Handwash. I coordinated PKD details from depots to
        maximize the freshness of inventory in the system. Apart from FG, I have also helped factories reduce old PM and
        minimize PM write-offs by checking with the Brand team for any plans to utilize existing inventory.</li>

    <li><strong>Operate within the prescribed inventory limits:</strong> Ensured factory adherence to changes in the
        last 3-week volume estimates to maintain quarter-end inventory within limits. The table below shows the
        Brand-wise quarter-end inventory.</li>

    <li><strong>Finding ways to save freight through Direct Factory to Depot or Customer:</strong> As a planner, I
        analyzed SKU-wise historical sale trends for all brands to move material production closer to high-demand areas.
        For instance:</li>

    <li>South (Karnataka/Kerala/AP) are high-selling markets for Classic HW 200ml BOGO. Accordingly, maximum production
        was moved from Amalner to Tumkur, and we started operating Tumkurâ€™s Bottle line in 2 shifts since Q1 2425.
        Tumkur production increased from ~80T in Q4 2324 to ~200T in Q1 2425.</li>

    <li>Chandrika HW has 95% sales in Kerala. Therefore, to optimize freight costs (initially from Amalner to Cochin), I
        initiated CHK REG HW 200ml BOGO production in Tumkur in Q4 2324 to save freight and lead time for material
        connectivity by about 50T (highest volume SKU).</li>

    <li>I analyzed depot-wise inventory of SKUs to identify regions with excess inventory and shared the findings with
        the distribution planner to relocate excess inventory to the nearest hubs. This was done to utilize existing
        inventory at the right time and depot.</li>
